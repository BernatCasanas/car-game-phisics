# Dodge Race

Dodge race is a racing game where you will have to get to the finish line dodging all the obstacles. 

## Usage

This game is played using these keys in the keyboard:

* Left with left arrow.

* Right with right arrow.

* Accelerate with up arrow.

* Brakes with down arrow.

* Restart (to checkpoint if activated) with R.

* Change camera (1st/3rd) with left mouse button.

* Exit the game with Escape.

## Guide

To win this game you have to avoid all the obstacles (except the big green doors, which are the checkpoints) and finish to the goal line without 
losing your three lives (you will lose one every time you hit an obstacle, changing the color of your car), to achieve this, we reccomend that 
even though it isn't as fun, you should control your speed to be able to dodge the obstacles easier. When you win, you will be able to play the
game with a higher difficulty, AKA play with one live less, this will happen until you have only 1 live (which would be impossible to decrease),
in which you will be able to play again in the same difficulty.
