## Guide and Explanation of the Game

To win this game you have to avoid all the obstacles (except the big green doors, which are the checkpoints) and finish to the goal line without 
losing your three lives (you will lose one every time you hit an obstacle, changing the color of your car), to achieve this, we reccomend that 
even though it isn't as fun, you should control your speed to be able to dodge the obstacles easier. When you win, you will be able to play the
game with a higher difficulty, AKA play with one live less, this will happen until you have only 1 live (which would be impossible to decrease),
in which you will be able to play again in the same difficulty. In the title of the window you'll see the score, first the level: which indicates how many lives you start with (level 1: 3 lives, level 2: 2 lives, level 3: 1 live); and then the hits: the number of obstacles hitted (when you hit one this obstacle will disappear making the game easier for you). You can play with your friends trying to improve your score (for example, pass level 3 with the lowest hits possible).
